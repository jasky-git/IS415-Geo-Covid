Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus, which has now spread worldwide. Currently, there are no available vaccines for global use. Because of that, it is important to study the spread of covid-19, understand where, when, and how it occurred by studying the spatio-temporal patterns of confirmed cases.

The project aims to provide a web-based geospatial application to identify areas with covid-19 and the factors affecting the spread. Most of the geospatial applications on covid-19 are limited to visualizing proportional point patterns. However, our group is also concerned about the factors affecting the spread of covid-19.

Due to the limited number of covid-19 data Singapore has to offer, our group has decided to focus on Hong Kong as the choice of study area as it offers more data as compared to Singapore. These data acquired from data.gov.hk include number of cases confirmed, location of confinement (?), which will be relevant to the analysis of the spatio-temporal patterns.

The web-enabled geospatial analytical tool is developed to allow users to view the spread of covid-19, as well as how to better plan for further spread and its mitigation.
